Web API Explorer Project

Aim is to build a simple Web APIs Explorer with open source APIs.

- Build two screens
- First screen renders button which opens sidebar with all API providers
- Click on provider will show all available Web APIs
- Click on Web APIs will redirect to second screen - API Service details
- Make API calls to https://api.apis.guru/v2/providers.json to get list of providers
- Make API calls to https://api.apis.guru/v2/{provider_name}.json to get web API services details
